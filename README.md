# Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction
Tic-tac-toe is a commonly known game that is played with 'O's and 'X's. To gain a better understanding of Object Oriented Programming, we have developed this game in Ruby.

## How to play
Tic -tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

Player one make the first move, giving the number of the position choosen by this player, then the second player has the move and make the same, and continue so on until somebody wins or they filled up all the spaces and it will be a tie.
